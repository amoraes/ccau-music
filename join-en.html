        <h1>Joining the Orchestra</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="step1">
        <h3>Purpose of the Orchestra</h3>
        <p>The orchestra in the Congregation of Christians has a single purpose: to help the brethren do sing our Hymns during the Holy Services.</p>
        <p>It is important to acknowledge that our orchestras execute a supporting role, and therefore there are no soloists or individual performances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="step2">
        <h3>Who can join the orchestra?</h3>
        <p>Everyone who shares the same faith and doctrine of Congregation of Christians and have a good reputation.</p>
        <p>Children and Young brothers and sisters of good reputation that are not yet baptized might be allowed to join after consideration from the Ministry.</p>
        <p>However, to be fully integrated with the orchestra and to play in the Holy Services it is required that the brother or sister is baptized according to the Word of God.</p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> playing in the orchestra is on a voluntary basis. There are no remuneration or rights to any sort of benefits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="step3">
        <h3>What attributes are expected from the ones that want to become part of the orchestra?</h3>
        <h5>Humbleness, sincerity e submission.</h5>
        <p><b>Humbleness:</b> the humble is not proud or considers itself important. It is not allowed in our orchestras behaviours that highlight individual skills or put a single person in prominence.</p>
        <p><b>Sincerity:</b> the desire to join the orchestra must be sincere before the Lord, and with the objective of serving God in the orchestra with the goal of helping the brethen to sing the Hymns.</p>
        <p><b>Submission: </b> our orchestras have a series of technical regulations and rules of conduct which have to be followed, added to the existing teachings that apply to all those who serve God according to
            the faith and doctrine of the Congregation of Christians. To be part of the orchestra it is a must that the brother or sister is submissive, accepting and practicing the teachings and always
            honouring the Ministry, Orchestra Assistants and Organists' Examiners.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="step4-brothers">
        <h3>Dress code: brothers</h3>
        <p>Our brothers playing in the orchestra must wear a suit and a tie.</p>
        <p>It is not acceptable to play with long hairs, beard or exquisite haircuts.</p>
        <p>The musicians must present themselves with modesty and simplicity in order to not draw any attention to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="step4-sisters">
        <h3>Dress code: sisters</h3>
        <p>Our sisters should not use clothes that are too tight or too short.</p>
        <p>It is not acceptable to play with short hair, coloured hair or exquisite haircuts.</p>
        <p>The musicians and organists must present themselves with modesty and simplicity in order to not draw any attention to them.</p>

        <h3>Steps to join the orchestra</h3>
        <p><b>1)</b> Speak with the Local or Regional Orchestra Assistant. He will present the brother or sister to the Ministry in order to receive counsels and explanations about the conditions required to be part of the orchestra, including the responsibilities and duties involved.</p>
        <p><b>2)</b> The Local or Regional Orchestra Assistant will inform the student which instruments he/she can choose from, according to the needs of the orchestra.</p>
        <p class="ms-5"><i>Note:</i>
            due to the size and characteristics of our orchestras we have a limited number of instruments that can join the orchestra, so it is important to not buy any instrument before speaking with the Local or Regional Orchestra Assistant.
        </p>
        <p><b>3)</b> Learning the instrument: students can learn the instrument in the Musical Study Groups organised in their local congregation or with a private teacher.</p>
        <p class="ms-5"><i>Note:</i> students learning through a private teacher must also follow the same minimum requirements established by Congregation of Christians.</p>
        <p><b>4)</b> Playing in the Local Music Rehearsals</p>
        <p>- When the student is quite advanced in his/her studies an evaluation is conducted by the Local Orchestra Assistant.</p>
        <p>- Depending on the outcome, the student can join the Local Music Rehearsals (in the local congregation only).</p>
        <p><b>5)</b> Playing in the Youth and Children's Meetings and Regional Music Rehearsals</p>
        <p>- After completing the minimum requirements the student knowledge will be pre-evaluated by the Local Orchestra Assistant.</p>
        <p>- Depending on the outcome, an exam will be scheduled with the Local or Regional Orchestra Assistant or the Organists' Examiner.</p>

        <p>- Caso aprovado, o(a) aluno(a) poderá tocar nos Santos Cultos da sua localidade apenas.</p>
        <p><i>Observação:</i> é necessário que o irmão ou a irmã sejam batizados de acordo com a Palavra de Deus para realizar este teste.</i>
        <p><b>7)</b> Oficialização</p>
